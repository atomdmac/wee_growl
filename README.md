# wee_growl
A python script for WeeChat that forwards notifications to a Growl deamon.

While there are plenty of Growl scripts for WeeChat, I couldn't get any of them to work with all of the protocols I use with WeeChat (like Slack).  To get around this (and because it's fun!) I peiced one together and put it here.  Feel free to use it however you wish.
